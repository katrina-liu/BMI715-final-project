## Description
Hypertension has been known to increase the risk for conditions including heart disease, heart attack, stroke, and etc (“High blood pressure (hypertension),” 2022). Diagnostic of hypertension is focused on systolic blood pressure level and the diastolic blood pressure level. The effect of treatment of hypertension greatly reflects on how these blood pressure levels change.

Motivated by this, in this project, we want to study which factors are associated with the systolic blood pressure level and build a predictive model for the systolic blood pressure level using the variables for the cohort that is already diagnosed with hypertension using the NHANES data (Disease Control & National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)., 2013-2014). The result of the study would be useful in better adjusting treatment plan for hypertension population.
